###Three Potential Questions

###1. Rail, Bus and Auto Transportation

#####What
Examine and predict auto traffic patterns on any given day based on rail and bus transportation data from the Denver Regional Transporation District's [University of Colorado A Line Commuter Rail](http://www.rtd-denver.com/a-line.shtml)

#####How
Compare commute data from the Denver Regional Transportation District (bus and rail data) and the Colorado Department of Transporation (auto traffic data) to try and predict auto traffic patterns. Using inputs such as day of the week, time of day, number of commuters on either the rail line or bus, and weather patterns, I want to try and predict what the auto traffic may be given certain conditions.

To begin with, data sources should be accessible at the following locations:

  * [Denver Regional Transportation District](http://www.rtd-denver.com/Developer.shtml) *(Ridership counts may not be available, but I will email RTD if needed to determine what data is available).*
  * [Colorado Department of Transportation](http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/otis)
  * [Historical Weather](http://apidev.accuweather.com/developers/) *(I think I can get free access to this API. If not, I will do more reserach to identify a free historical weather API).*

#####Why
Initially I wanted to build a model specifically for the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) system being implemented in the North Bay Area. In the past few weeks, SMART has announced a delay in its scheduled launch date due to technical difficulties ([Press Democrat - 10/13/16](http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/6189496-181/sonoma-marin-area-rail-transit-struggling)).

With this SMART development and several references in recent articles to a newly opened commuter line between downtown Denver and the Denver International Airport, I am chosing to use the Denver region as a study area instead. If this project is chosen, and successful, I hope it is replicable for SMART in the future.


###2. Ulia's Delicatessen Sales

#####What
Ulia's Delicatessen is owned by my boyfriend's family and has two locations, one in Santa Rosa, CA and one in Petaluma, CA. They use the Square POS system and I am able to access their Square account for daily sales data. I would like to export historical daily sales data to try and predict customer purchases based on day, time, location, weather, and new versus returning customer. 

#####How 
Using the login information, I should easily be able to pull historical sales data. Beyond that, I may need to find historical weather data, likely from the same source listed in the thrid bullet point above.


#####Why
The Ulia's Delicatessen owner is interested in using the Square POS system more effectively and robustly to help increase sales. This project is a potential starting point to determine who buys what and when. In the future, this project could be expanded to guide the methodolody for offering promotional deals through email, implementing instant rewards for frequent customers, or monitoring sales based on employee. 

**Oh**, I also eat there for free most days, and it's an opportunity to stay in the good graces of my future mother-in-law **:)**


###3. ESRI and ArcGIS

#####What

This is a rather vague idea, but I have access to an ESRI account through work. I am unsure if I will need
