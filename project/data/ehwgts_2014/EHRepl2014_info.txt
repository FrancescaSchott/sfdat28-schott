
The data file ehwgts_2014.dat (2014 ATUS Eating & Health Module Replicate weights file) contains 161 variables and 11,212 records.  The variables are:  TUCASEID, and 
EUFINLWGT001...EUFINLWGT160.  TUCASEID is defined in the ATUS 2014 Eating & Health Module Data Dictionary, 
available at:  http://www.bls.gov/tus/ehmintcodebk1416.pdf.  EUFINLWGT001...EUFINLWGT160 are 
replicate weights for the variable EUFINLWGT (the variable EUFINLWGT is also defined in the ATUS 2014 Eating & Health Module Data Dictionary). 

In addition to the data file, three computer programs are contained in ehwgts_2014.zip. If you have SPSS, SAS, 
or Stata software, you may use these programs to read the data into your statistical software package.  

The file "ehwgts_2014.sps" reads the data into SPSS.

The file "ehwgts_2014.sas" reads the data into SAS.

The file "ehwgts_2014.do" reads the data into Stata.

If you have SAS, SPSS, or Stata software, open the corresponding program, edit the infile (in SAS), 
file (in SPSS) or insheet (in Stata) statement to reference the data file on your computer, and run the program.

The Eating & Health Replicate weights are very similar to the ATUS replicate weights. Both are based on the replicate weights developed for the CPS. ATUS begins with the CPS 
replicate weight after the first-stage ratio adjustment.  Each replicate is processed through all of the stages of 
the ATUS weighting procedure.  The CPS replicate weights are based on a modified balanced half-sample method of 
replication, developed in the 1980s by Robert Fay.
